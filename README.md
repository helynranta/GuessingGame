GUESSING GAME
=============

This is Guessing Game, Invididual Course assigment at Lappeenranta University of Technology, course CT30A5002 Games and Networking (7 cr) fall 2015. Assigment was about creating a online game with both TCP and UDP connection. Chat was meant to be implemented, and game mechanics was meant to be created around idea of quessing a number.

#### Implementation
Game was created with engine code I created for group project. It has a lot of unused and unnecessary functions and classes that I didn't have time to remove.

Dependencies
```bash
libsdl2 libsdl2_ttf
```

By pressing one number in chat game expects that you wish to send a quess. Quesses are between 1-9. Limitations of the input are that there is no shift/ctrl keys in input manager. Keys are interpreted with their names, because for some reason i thought it would be good idea at the time.

This assignment had all required features and got rated 100%
